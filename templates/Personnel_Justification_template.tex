What personnel are already in place and what are their roles on the project? If applicable, describe (i) personnel that will be hired for the project in the future and their responsibilities and (ii) potential personnel turnover that may occur during the project and a strategy for replacing them.

{\noindent \bf  {MANAGEMENT PLAN}}

Describe the project's leadership team and how decisions are made to allocate time to individuals or, for proposals with multiple collaborating teams, subgroups within the project. Describe the focus of each individual or subgroup. Successful proposals will include a management plan that conveys to reviewers the interrelationship between subgroups and how the sum of the parts will lead to scientific discovery or engineering solutions that are the overarching goal of the project. Also identify points of contact who will provide updates on the status of the work including publications, awards, and highlights of accomplishments.
