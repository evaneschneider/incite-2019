{\bf Research Interests and Expertise\\}
{\parindent 16pt
Co-PI Fielding's research interests are focused on understanding how the interplay of galactic winds and small scale physical processes in circumgalactic medium regulate galaxy formation. To study this process Fielding has investigated how galactic winds are launched by the collective effect of numerous supernovae, and how these winds expand into, stir, and heat the circumgalactic medium.
Fielding's work has consisted primarily of designing controlled numerical experiments to isolate specific phenomena and address well-posed questions. This work has given Fielding extensive experience using hydrodynamical simulations, and, in particular, implementing additional physical processes to couple to the hydrodynamics such as radiative cooling, thermal conduction, turbulent driving, and supernova explosions. As a graduate student Fielding served as Co-I on accepted NSF Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) computational proposals ``Conduction, Convection, and Thermal Instability in Hot Halos'' (TG-AST140083) and ``The Physics of Supernova Feedback: Global 3D Simulations of Galactic Disks'' (TG-AST160020) that were awarded a total of 3.6 million cpu hours. }
